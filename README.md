## Inspiration
I came to this Hackathon to support my friends in the SMU CS club, as well as to support my lovely boyfriend who is the president of this club. I knew I wanted to do something that reminded me of my love of CS while having no academic ties to it. Why not have fun, and unoptimize one of the most simple projects known to CS majors? I also wanted to challenge myself by using one of the fastest languages known to man.

# Constraints
1. Every piece of code has to contribute to somehow printing hello world (i.e. can't do random calculations to increase time). In this case, I am not counting pre-processing statements as executable code.
2. I am using one of the fastest languages just to add an extra challenge. 
3. As long as the program would finish in theory given infinite time, I am counting it. 

## What it does
It should eventually print out "Hello World!". Hopefully the universe dies before it ever achieves that though. 

## How we built it
Hopes, dreams, the programming language c, and CLion.
