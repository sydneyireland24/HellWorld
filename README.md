## Inspiration
I came to this Hackathon to support my friends in the SMU CS club, as well as to support my lovely boyfriend who is the president of this club. I knew I wanted to do something that reminded me of my love of CS while having no academic ties to it. Why not have fun, and unoptimize one of the most simple projects known to CS majors? I also wanted to challenge myself by using one of the fastest languages known to man.

# Constraints
1. Every piece of code has to contribute to somehow printing hello world (i.e. can't do random calculations to increase time). In this case, I am not counting pre-processing statements as executable code. Other than that, any other unoptimizations are fair game.
2. I am using one of the fastest languages just to add an extra challenge. 
3. As long as the program would finish in theory given infinite time, I am counting it. 

## What it does
It should eventually print out "Hello World!". The universe will probably die before it ever achieves that though. 

## How we built it
Hopes, dreams, the programming language c, and CLion.

## Challenges we ran into
I forgot some of the formatting flags for C print statements because I haven't worked with C since Operating Systems.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I cannot believe I got one attempt at printing "Hello World!" to take on average 32.17 seconds. 

## What we learned
Human curiosity and the motivation of enjoyment are quite the fire starters for making such a convoluted project. 

## What's next for Hell World
It will hopefully one day be migrated to Python, and I will hopefully add a GUI aspect to make it run even slower.
